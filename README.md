## Chess Openings Engine

I built a chess openings recommendation engine to learn about data processing, analysis and visualization. My goal was to learn more about data analysis with Python, and to explore my passion for chess

I plan to build an interactive UI to recommend users new chess openings based on their played openings from a popular online chess site (such as Chess.com and Lichess). 

## Tools Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

I ended up implementing a collaborative filtering approach, leveraging the cosine similarity metric to recommend chess openings to users. The data was filtered to include only users who have at least 2 games played in the dataset, and I explored and visualized the variance in the data to explore the feasability of the task initially.
