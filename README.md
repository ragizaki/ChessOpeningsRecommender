## Chess Openings Engine

I built a chess openings recommendation engine to learn about data processing, analysis and visualization. I built this to learn more about data analysis with Python, and to explore my interests regarding chess openings.

I plan to build an interactive UI to recommend users new chess openings based on their played openings from a popular online chess site (such as Chess.com and Lichess). 

## Tools Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

I ended up implementing a collaborative filtering approach, leveraging cosine similarity metric to recommend chess openings to users based on their most played openings from the dataset.
